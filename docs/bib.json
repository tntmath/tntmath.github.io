    "abstract": "In general, the value function associated with an exit time problem is a discontinuous function. We prove that the lower (upper) semicontinuous envelope of the value function is a supersolution (subsolution) of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation involving the proximal subdifferentials (superdifferentials) with subdifferential-type (superdifferential-type) mixed boundary condition. We also show that if the value function is upper semicontinuous, then it is the maximum subsolution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation involving the proximal superdifferentials with the natural boundary condition, and if the value function is lower semicontinuous, then it is the minimum solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation involving the proximal subdifferentials with a natural boundary condition. Futhermore, if a compatibility condition is satisfied, then the value function is the unique lower semicontinuous solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation with a natural boundary condition and a subdifferential type boundary condition. Some conditions ensuring lower semicontinuity of the value functions are also given.",

		"abstract": "This paper investigates the well-posedness of a type of state constraint ergodic Mean Field Game system in a bounded domain in which the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is paired with an infinite Dirichlet boundary condition. In this setting, the infinite boundary condition prevents the underlying stochastic trajectories from reaching the boundary, resulting in a state constraint solution. We consider a class of superlinear power-like Hamiltonians and establish existence and uniqueness results under appropriate assumptions on the coupling. We treat both non-local and local couplings, and establish the uniqueness of the system by exploiting the decay of the density near the boundary.",

    "abstract": "We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to a family of discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equations, posed in RN, when the discount factor goes to zero. The ambient space being noncompact, we introduce an assumption implying that the Aubry set is compact and there is no degeneracy at infinity. Our approach is to deal not with a single Hamiltonian and Lagrangian but with the whole space of generalized Lagrangians, and then to define via duality minimizing measures associated with both the corresponding ergodic and discounted equations. The asymptotic result follows from the convergence properties of these measures concerning the narrow topology. We use as duality tool a separation theorem in locally convex Hausdorff spaces, and we use the strict topology in the space of the bounded generalized Lagrangians as well.",
