    "abstract": "We study the Dirichlet problem for viscous Hamilton–Jacobi equations. Despite this type of equations seems to be uniformly elliptic, loss of boundary conditions may occur because of the strong nonlinearity of the first-order part and therefore the Dirichlet boundary condition has to be understood in the sense of viscosity solutions theory. Under natural assumptions on the initial and boundary data, we prove a Strong Comparison Result which allows us to obtain the existence and the uniqueness of a continuous solution which is defined globally in time. Résumé Nous étudions le problème de Dirichlet pour des équations non linéaires paraboliques de type Hamilton–Jacobi avec viscosité. Bien que ces équations semblent uniformément elliptiques, des pertes de conditions aux limites peuvent se produire à cause de la forte non-linéarité du terme du premier ordre et on doit utiliser la notion de condition aux limites généralisée au sens de la théorie des solutions de viscosité. Sous des hypothèses naturelles sur la donnée initiale et la condition au bord, nous démontrons un résultat de comparaison fort qui nous permet d’obtenir l’existence et l’unicité d’une solution de viscosité continue qui est définie pour tous temps.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a result of homogenization of first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations with ( $$u/\\varepsilon$$ )-periodic Hamiltonians. On the one hand, under a coercivity assumption on the Hamiltonian (and some natural regularity assumptions), we prove an ergodicity property of this equation and the existence of nonperiodic approximate correctors. On the other hand, the proof of the convergence of the solution, usually based on the introduction of a perturbed test function in the spirit of Evans’s work, uses here a twisted perturbed test function for a higher-dimensional problem.",

In a second part, we consider the large time behavior of periodic solutions of Hamilton–Jacobi Equations: we describe recents results obtained by using partial differential equations type arguments. This part is complementary of the course of H. Ishii which presents the dynamical system approach (“weak KAM approach”).",

    "abstract": "In general, the value function associated with an exit time problem is a discontinuous function. We prove that the lower (upper) semicontinuous envelope of the value function is a supersolution (subsolution) of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation involving the proximal subdifferentials (superdifferentials) with subdifferential-type (superdifferential-type) mixed boundary condition. We also show that if the value function is upper semicontinuous, then it is the maximum subsolution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation involving the proximal superdifferentials with the natural boundary condition, and if the value function is lower semicontinuous, then it is the minimum solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation involving the proximal subdifferentials with a natural boundary condition. Futhermore, if a compatibility condition is satisfied, then the value function is the unique lower semicontinuous solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation with a natural boundary condition and a subdifferential type boundary condition. Some conditions ensuring lower semicontinuity of the value functions are also given.",

In this setting, the infinite boundary condition prevents the underlying stochastic trajectories from reaching the boundary, resulting in a state constraint solution. We consider a class of superlinear power-like Hamiltonians and establish existence and uniqueness results under appropriate assumptions on the coupling. We treat both non-local and local couplings, and establish the uniqueness of the system by exploiting the decay of the density near the boundary.",

    "abstract": "We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to a family of discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equations, posed in RN, when the discount factor goes to zero. The ambient space being noncompact, we introduce an assumption implying that the Aubry set is compact and there is no degeneracy at infinity. Our approach is to deal not with a single Hamiltonian and Lagrangian but with the whole space of generalized Lagrangians, and then to define via duality minimizing measures associated with both the corresponding ergodic and discounted equations. The asymptotic result follows from the convergence properties of these measures concerning the narrow topology. We use as duality tool a separation theorem in locally convex Hausdorff spaces, and we use the strict topology in the space of the bounded generalized Lagrangians as well.",

    "abstract": "We propose a PDE approach to the Aubry-Mather theory using viscosity solutions. This allows to treat Hamiltonians (on the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^N$ ) just coercive, continuous and quasiconvex, for which a Hamiltonian flow cannot necessarily be defined. The analysis is focused on the family of Hamilton-Jacobi equations $$H(x,Du) = a$$ with a real parameter, and in particular on the unique equation of the family, corresponding to the so-called critical value a = c, for which there is a viscosity solution on $\\mathbb{T}^N$ . We define generalized projected Aubry and Mather sets and recover several properties of these sets holding for regular Hamiltonians.",
